Create a complete, responsive, and modern single-page website for "Prompt Minds Coaching Center" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — all code must be written in a single index.html file.

Project Requirements:
1. Use Firebase Firestore as the database.
2. The website should have:
   - A beautiful hero section with the name “Prompt Minds Coaching Center”, tagline “Empowering Minds Through AI and Learning”, and a background image.
   - An Admission Form Section with the following input fields:
     - Full Name
     - Father’s Name
     - Email ID
     - Date of Birth
     - Gender (Male/Female/Other)
     - Course (Dropdown – AI, Web Development, Psychology, Freelancing, or Other)
     - Address
     - A “Submit Form” button that saves all data to Firebase Firestore.
   - A success message like “ Your Admission Form Has Been Successfully Submitted!”

3. At the bottom footer, add a small button labeled “Admin Login”.
   - When clicked, it opens a password prompt (e.g., `Enter Admin Key:`).
   - If the correct admin key is entered (for example: `promptminds2025`), then it shows the Admin Panel.

4. Admin Panel Features:
   - Display all submitted admission forms in a clean, tabular layout.
   - Each row should show:
     - Name, Email, Mobile, Course, and Date of Submission.
   - Include a Delete button next to each entry to remove it from Firebase.
   - Include a Download CSV” button to export all admission data as a CSV file.

5. The design should look professional:
   - Use light blue and white theme.
   - Rounded corners, smooth hover effects, and good spacing.
   - Mobile responsive layout.

6. Use Firebase SDK (Firestore) directly in JavaScript (no external backend or framework).

7. Make sure all Firebase configurations are clearly mentioned in a section like:
   ```js
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
     projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
     storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
     messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
     appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
   };
